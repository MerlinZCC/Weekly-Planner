**Project Description:**\
We will be creating a local-first web application using CRUD-operations that allows users to keep track on their pending tasks. Users will be asked to either sign in or sign up depending on whether they have an account. After logging in, the user will be redirected to their home page, which will display the tasks they added, if any. If the user signs up, they will redirected to the home page which will display an empty to-do-list. Users will have the ability to create, remove, update, and delete tasks for each day of the week. Additonally, with the completion of task, the user will be given the ability to mark it as complete.
