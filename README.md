# Web App: Weekly Planner

## Project Overview

We developed a local-first web application that empowers users to manage their daily and weekly tasks efficiently. The app allows users to sign up or log in, create and organize tasks, and track their progress throughout the week. With a focus on simplicity and usability, the app leverages CRUD operations to provide a seamless task management experience, with data persistence ensured via local storage.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Users can sign up or log in to access their personalized task lists. New users start with an empty to-do list, while returning users can continue from where they left off.
- **Task Management**: Users can easily create new tasks, edit task descriptions, delete tasks, and mark tasks as complete.
- **Weekly Progress Tracking**: Tasks are organized by day, with a visual indicator showing the completion status for each day of the week.
- **CRUD Operations**: Full support for creating, reading, updating, and deleting tasks, with data stored locally to ensure persistence across sessions.
- **Responsive UI**: A responsive and intuitive user interface designed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, ensuring accessibility across devices.
