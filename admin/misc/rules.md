## Primary Means of Communication and Expectations

- All members will be expected to read slack messages from anyone in the group on a daily basis and respond in not more than 12 hours.
- The member who is assigned with the task must be available on the day of the deadline for the task. If something else occurs, the member must address the issue prior to the day of deadline.

## Scheduling Meetings (Schedule at least one meeting as part of constructing your team agreement.)

- Team will agree, at the end of each class, to set any meeting times and agenda needed before the next class and beyond if possible. Team members will take turns to send out a reminder of the meeting with an agenda within eight hours after the class.
- The scheduled meetings are mandatory for all the team members and all the team members are required to attend. If a member wants to skip a meeting it should be discussed with the team leader at least a day before the meeting.

## General Responsibilities for All Team Members

- Be present at team meetings, but also actively participate to ensure deadlines are met.
- Communicate issues that pertain to the project to ensure the development of the app runs as smoothly as possible.
- Come to meetings prepared, and contribute to group discussions.
- Finish assigned task by deadline, but if anything uncontrollable occurs, report to team leader at least one day before deadline if team member are unable to make it

## Conflict Resolution

- If a team member is not meeting deadlines, the team agrees to give the person a notice to address the problem before bringing the issue to a TA or professor.
- If problems persist, the person will have to set up a one-on-one meeting with the lead TA for further solutions.

## Expectations of Faculty and GTAâ€™s

- If a team member fails to live up to this agreement, the situation may be reported to the staff, but the team will still be responsible for submitting a completed assignment. Staff will be available to meet with teams to resolve issues.
