[What is a Cowboy Coder?](https://www.techslang.com/definition/what-is-cowboy-coding/)

**Code Cowboys** was named after the team's shared interest in creating a project through careful planning and open-ended discussion. As we develop our project, we strive to uphold a cowboy's ambitious drive to explore undiscovered heights while innovating a new pathway for others to embark on. We hope to redefine **'Cowboy Coding'** by reminding ourselves to collaborate with one another and hold ourselves to the policies and standard we agreed on at the start of the project. With such inspirations, we will use the positives of Cowboy Coding to develop a creative solution that benefits the experience and needs of users in the *real world*.

# Team Values
## Ambitious
* We are willing to take risks and face failure in our attempt to find efficient solutions across our product. 
## Adventurous
* We seek unmapped techniques to learn uncommon yet durable features and systems that can be integrated into our app. 
## Innovative 
* We aim to develop a unique product that is both valuable and informative to the public, ultimately creating a project that can be modeled after by others.
