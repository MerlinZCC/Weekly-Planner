## Context and Problem Statement

What should be put for our first sprint and second sprint? 

## Decision Drivers

- We want to make sure even if accidents occur and we cannot complete all parts of project, we have something solid to present 
- We want to make sure each team member have similar amount of workload throughout sprints 
- We want to make sure each team member can get chance to work with frontend & backend 

## Considered Options

- Do signup/log in flow first, homepage for to-do-list app second
- Do homepage for to-do-list app first, signup/log in flow second
- Separate team into sub-teams to do homepage and signup/login page synchronously first, and coordinate them second

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: Do page synchronously with sub-teams, because everyone will have similar amount of workload and have access to both front end & back end. Also, subteam allows for easier communication and arrangement with each team leads.

### Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->

- everyone in team will have similar amount of workload throughout sprint 
- team all have access with front end and back end
- sub-team allows for more effective communication and easier arrangement

### Negative Consequences <!-- optional -->

- There is a risk for final product if we don't have time to connect signup/login flow with home page in the second sprint eventually
