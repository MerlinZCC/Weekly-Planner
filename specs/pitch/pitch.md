## Statement of Purpose
Most to-do list apps can be overwhelming - with the ability to plan weeks or months into the future. However, to-do lists were originally used with the intent of jotting down quick tasks to be completed in a short span of time. The purpose of this web application is to visualize a to-do-list that users can categorize their weekly tasks in (sports, chores) and mark tasks as completed and/or delete the task from the list. The application should create a weekly list of tasks, where they user can view their plans, check off completed tasks, update their schedule when plans have changed, and delete certain tasks for whatever reasons.
## User Personas
Persona Group: student
​
Fictional Name: Jane Smith
​
Occupation: undergraduate student at UCSD
​
Demographics:
* 21 years old
* pursuing bachelors degree in Computer Science
Goals/Tasks:
Taking multiple courses during studies, along with participating in extracurriculars such as clubs, sports, etc. Needs to:
* keep track of coursework and due dates
* tasks to complete for extracurriculars
​
Environment: Comfortable using a computer and an intermediate internet user. Has an internet connection at home and multiple devices with internet access. Uses email and the internet extensively as coursework is mostly submitted online these days. Internet-savvy usually means extremely discerning with the apps they will use - functionality and aesthetic are most important.
### Personal
The user can be anywhere between 10-80 years old. The application should be accessible to all, from schoolchildren to the elderly. Therefore, it should be easy to navigate, regardless of level of education.
### Professional
As a web application, it can only be used by those with access to the internet and personal devices with such access. It will most likely be used by those with regular weekly schedules, with multiple tasks to be completed each week, including students, professionals, and many more.
### Technological
A regular user would typically be using both a laptop and a smartphone. Today, both school and work are integrated with the internet and various productivity apps - Zoom, Google Classroom, Canvas, Slack, etc. Such applications usually have both a mobile and desktop interface.
### Motivation
Users will most likely be motivated by a need to stay on top of their tasks - a way to look at the upcoming week at a glance and how busy they will be during the week.
## Time
The team only has 5 weeks to complete this, which significantly constrains the solution - this will affect both quality and the number of features that can be included.

## Risk and Rabbit Holes
1. Communication in the group project is very crucial, report progress and obstacles on time can avoid potential dealay. If one member stuck at some point and did not report on time, then it could slow donw the entire progress.
​
2. While design the project, it can not have complicated or too many features since there are limited time to work on it.
​
3. Weekly meetings are essential, lack of meetings or lack of participation can also cause delays. 
​
4. Improper task assignment may lead to unefficient work.
​
5. Unclear design or insufficient plan detail can also make progress slow.
​
6. Procrastination is a significant factor in low project completion. Start late or rush through the work will leads to bad product.

## Things to avoid / Limitations

1. ability to share/post to-do lists
2. calender set-up
